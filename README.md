For:
📄 index.html file of Sardar Raja College of Engineering Website

🔧 1. Set Up Locally (on your own computer)
✅ Step 1: Create the Project Folder

Create a new folder on your computer. Name it something like:

Paste it into your editor.

Save the file as:

Make sure the file is saved with .html extension (not .txt!).

✅ Step 3: Preview in Browser

Double-click index.html.

It will open in your default web browser.

🎉 You’ll now see your college homepage with:

Hero banner

🌐 2. Host the Website Online (Free Methods)
🟦 Option 1: GitHub Pages (Best for Students)

Upload your index.html file.

🟩 Option 2: Netlify (Drag-and-Drop Hosting)

🗃️ 3. Optional: Organize Code in Folders

Later, you can split code like this for a more professional project structure:

sardar-raja-college/
│
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── style.css       ← move all <style> content here
├── js/
│   └── script.js       ← move all <script> content here
└── images/
    └── logo.png        ← add any image files if needed


Then update the index.html to include external files:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
<script src="js/script.js" defer></script>

💡 4. Notes About the Comment Section

Your comments are stored in localStorage, so:

They stay saved only in the same browser and on the same device.

Different users won’t see each other's comments unless a backend is used.

💬 If you want shared comments for all users, you'll need a backend like:

Google Firebase (easy)

PHP + MySQL

Node.js + Express

Let me know if you'd like help with that.
